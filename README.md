### **About Me**
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Julien, a passionate motorsport enthusiast. With a background in supply chain, sales consulting and e-commerce I thrive on tackling challenging problems and building innovative solutions.


ðŸŒ± #### **What I'm Currently Learning**

I'm currently diving deeper into content creation, digital marketing and videography, honing my skills in driving race cars, and exploring new ways to fulfill my dreams.


ðŸ’¼ #### **My Professional Background**

I have over 4 years of experience in supply chain, where I've worked for the biggest chemical company in the world. My journey has led me to work in Japan as a Tourism Sales consultant, then I became a Shopify store co-owner and built my own Omamori collection. I had the honor to collaborate with Rocket Bunny, R.W.B, 326 POWER, Illiminate, Lonely Driver and Legends Media enriching my knowledge and expertise along the way. This led me to learn how to code at Le Wagon Tokyo where I dived into a completely new & fascinating universe, even building my first app: binfind!


ðŸš€ #### **What I Bring to the Table**

Passion: I'm deeply passionate about everything motorsport related, from amateur track days in Japan, Time Attack Events, Super GT, WEC, F1 and continuously seek opportunities to grow and learn to become a better driver.
Creativity: I approach challenges with a creative mindset, exploring innovative solutions to complex problems.
Collaboration: I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with diverse multicultural teams to achieve common goals.
